ðŸ”’ Security JSON Summarizer
A Python-based tool for intelligent summarization and analysis of security scan data from network hosts. This tool processes JSON files containing host vulnerability data, threat intelligence, and service information to generate comprehensive security reports using GPT-based AI summarization.

Intelligent Chunking: Automatically splits large JSON files into processable chunks while maintaining context
Vulnerability Prioritization: Identifies and prioritizes critical security threats, including malware detection
Multi-Strategy Processing:

Prioritize by vulnerability severity
Group by Autonomous System Number (ASN)
Sequential processing


Token Optimization: Reduces token usage by up to 70% through intelligent field selection
Scalable Architecture: Handles files from a few hosts to thousands

Security Analysis

Critical vulnerability detection (CVE tracking)
Malware identification (including C2 servers)
Threat intelligence integration
Risk level assessment
Service exposure analysis
Certificate validation checks

User Interface

GUI Application: User-friendly tkinter interface
Multi-tab Output: Executive summary, chunk details, and raw JSON views
Real-time Statistics: Token usage, chunk count, processing metrics
Export Functionality: Save reports as text or JSON


Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher
OpenAI API key (for GPT integration)

Install Dependencies
```bash conda env create -f environment.yml```
For GUI support:

```
Usage
CLI Usage
pythonfrom json_summarizer import JSONSummarizer, HostSummaryConfig

# Configure processing strategy
config = HostSummaryConfig(
    prioritize_vulns=True,      # Group by vulnerability severity
    group_by_asn=False,         # Alternative: group by network
    max_hosts_per_chunk=50,     # Hosts per chunk
    max_tokens_per_chunk=3000   # Token limit per chunk
)

# Initialize summarizer
summarizer = JSONSummarizer(model="gpt-5", config=config)

# Process JSON file
result = summarizer.process_json("path/to/security_scan.json")

# Access results
```python
print(result['executive_summary'])
print(f"Processed {result['statistics']['total_hosts']} hosts")
print(f"Created {result['statistics']['chunks_created']} chunks")
```
GUI Usage
```bash python gui_summarizer.py```

Processing Strategies

Prioritize Vulnerabilities (Default)

Critical hosts with malware: 20 hosts/chunk
High-risk hosts: 30 hosts/chunk
Normal hosts: 50 hosts/chunk


Group by ASN

Analyzes hosts within same network
Useful for network-wide security assessment


Sequential

Processes hosts in order
Best for small datasets



API Setup
OpenAI Configuration

Get your API key from OpenAI Platform
Add to your code:

```python def call_gpt_api(self, prompt: str) -> str:
    import openai
    openai.api_key = "your-api-key-here"  # Use environment variable in production
    
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=self.model,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        temperature=0.3,  # Lower for consistent summaries
        max_tokens=500
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```
Or use environment variable:

```bash export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here" ```
Examples
Example 1: Analyzing Critical Infrastructure
python# Focus on critical vulnerabilities
config = HostSummaryConfig(
    prioritize_vulns=True,
    max_hosts_per_chunk=20  # Smaller chunks for detailed analysis
)

summarizer = JSONSummarizer(config=config)
result = summarizer.process_json("critical_infrastructure.json")
Example 2: Network-Wide Analysis
```python # Group by ASN for network patterns
config = HostSummaryConfig(
    group_by_asn=True,
    max_hosts_per_chunk=100  # Larger chunks for network analysis
)
```
summarizer = JSONSummarizer(config=config)
result = summarizer.process_json("network_scan.json")

Known Issues

Large files (>1000 hosts) may require chunked API calls
Token limits may require adjustment for very detailed vulnerability data
GUI requires tkinter (included in most Python installations)
